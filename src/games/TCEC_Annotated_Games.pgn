sideline, and a dubious one at that. Black does not usually castle this early
in Bg5 Najdorf, at least not until he has had some counterplay going on the
queenside. The presence of the pawn on h6 makes this idea even more suspicious
as now White can open up Black's kingside with the usual g4-g5 thrust even
faster.} ({Black have tried here} 9... Qc7) (9... Nbd7) ({and even} 9... g5 {
with acceptable results.}) 10. O-O-O Bd7 {This Rauzer-like development is in
fact more appropriate here. Black needs to challenge White in the centre
immediately as otherwise he might get crushed on the kingside.} ({More in
Najdorf-style would be} 10... Qc7 {which was played in the only two "decent"

Black.}) 11. Bf2 $5 {I like this cautious move in young Karpov's style by
Komodo.} (11. g4 {would be the most straightforward approach, but then} Nc6 {

two correspodence games, White winning both of them pretty convincingly,

suddenly White loses material.}) 12... b5 13. e5 {The proper reaction to
Black's previous move. For one, c6 knight has lost its foothold after b7-b5

can push d6-d5 in the Sicilian.}) 13... Nxd4 14. Bxd4 dxe5 15. fxe5 Nd5 {Black
is ready to except a worse, but solid position.} ({Alternatively, he could go
for a Scheveningen-like maneouvre} 15... Ne8 {when he can defend against the

either and probably has better attacking prospects compared to the game.}) 16.

can sum up the opening results as favorable for White. He has achieved a
better position without any risk. Black can be partly satisfied as he has
avoided immediate disaster, which seems to be more or less the typical
scenario in this dubiuos line (9...0-0?!)} Rb8 19. g4 g6 {This prophylaxis is
probably necessary in order to avoid a direct assault, for instance} ({in case

pressure with} 20. Bf2 {followed by Qg3, h4 etc.}) 20. Rgf1 {Komodo continues
on a positional course.} ({However, I think it was possible to attack as well

Black has to show great precision in defence.}) 20... Rc8 21. h3 {Black's
position is passive, but quite solid - it's not simple for White to break
through - so we will witness some light maneouvering until the position clears
up a bit.} Re8 22. Bf5 {Of course, the bishop is immune.} Rf8 (22... gxf5 $4
23. gxf5 {would lead to a quick checkmate along the g-file.}) 23. a3 (23. Bxe6

course, Black is looking to get some counterplay, but generally opening up the
position favors the side that holds the initiative. Strictly strategically
speaking, White should be happy with this pawn exchange as in such positions
he is usually the one that tries to push a2-a4 in order to create a pawn
weakness on Black's queenside (either b5 or a6). With his last move Black has
done this job for him and now he always needs to be careful about the a-pawn,
which could prove especially weak in all sorts of endgames.} ({It might have
been more prudent for him to sit tight with a neutral move such as} 25... Bh4 {
but then again, how many people (and engines!) would forego an opportunity to
finally get some counterplay?}) 26. axb4 Rxb4 27. Bf5 $1 {Diagram [#] We've
already seen this move, but in this case it is more effective. White will now
play on both sides of the board so he needs to clear the third rank for his
heavy pieces and create some weaknesses on the kingside. This move is perfect
for both ends.} Qc8 28. Bxe6 fxe6 {The right positional decision.} ({The
alternative} 28... Qxe6 {seems to be playable as well. However, the queen is
very passive on e6, as well as the rook on f8. The game can continue something
like this} 29. h4 a5 30. h5 g5 31. Qd3+ Kg8 32. Rf5 a4 33. Rdf1 {with a
difficult position for Black. Now any time Black moves his queen from e6,
White can sacrifice the e-pawn to open up his bishop with dangerous threats to
Black king. It should also be noted that} a3 {is not dangerous due to} 34. b3 {
and White will pick up the weak a-pawn later on.}) 29. Rxf8 Qxf8 30. Qd3 Qa8
31. Rf1 Kg7 {Black succeeded in trading off its passive rook for white's
attacking one. However, white initiative still hasn't died as he finds new
ways to attack the king.} 32. Qe3 Rb8 33. Rf6 $1 {Looks scary, but Stockfish
finds a cold-blooded defence.} Qc6 $1 ({Taking the exchange} 33... Bxf6 34.
exf6+ Kh7 {leads to a strong initiative for White after} 35. Qxe6 Qb7 36. h4 {
etc.}) 34. Qf2 Rb7 35. Rf7+ Kg8 {and White has to retreat.} 36. Rf3 Rb8 37. b3

$5 {Komodo is just as resourceful.} g5 ({Now} 38... a5 {doesn't work because of
} 39. Qa7) 39. Qe3 Ra8 $2 {An obvious mistake, although it is less obvious
that it is the losing one! Black is playing for the attack too stubbornly,} ({
when it should have thought about safety. Why not} 39... Rf8 {? After the
inevitable rook exchange,} 40. Rxf8+ ({In this case} 40. Rf6 {is not as
dangerous as in the game since Black has} Bxf6 41. exf6 Rxf6 $1 42. Qe5 (42.

the pedestrian} 42... Qf1+ 43. Kb2 Kf7) 43. Kb2 Qd7 44. Qh8+ Kf7 45. Qxh6 d4 {
and White should better hold a perpetual.}) 40... Kxf8 {White would have a
small plus in the endgame, but it should be nothing serious.}) 40. Rf6 $1 {For
the second time in the game, Komodo goes for a recurring sacrificial motive.
This time around, Black has to accept the sacrifice.} Bxf6 41. exf6 Kf7 ({

winning using the fact that the pawn endgame after} Qxf6 49. Qxf6+ Kxf6 50. c4
{is winning.}) 42. h4 Qb8 43. Qd3 $3 {Diagram [#] The key move! This position
is very reminiscent of Carlsen-Caruana game from the Zurich chess tournament
two months ago, which Carlsen won in a very nice style after sacrificing the
exchange in a similar fashion. Maybe Komodo was inspired by that game? :)} ({
Stockfish was undoubtedly expecting} 43. hxg5 hxg5 44. Qxg5 {when} Qg8 45. Qf4
a5 46. g5 a4 {should give him enough counterplay.}) 43... Qg8 44. h5 $1 {
Another quiet move with great impact. Now the point of last two moves becomes
obvious - White has basically stalemated Black queen.} Ra7 {Black's position
is already beyond saving.} (44... Ke8 {doesn't help. White demonstrates his
winning plan} 45. Be5 Qf7 46. Qg6 $1 {the queen exchange is hopeless, so White
continues to pick up kingside pawns, winning easily as well.}) ({The desperado
attempt} 44... a5 45. Be5 a4 {runs into the counterattack} 46. c4 $1 axb3 47.

amount of material.}) 45. Be5 Rd7 {Basically resigning, but there was nothing
better.} ({If Black sits with} 45... Kf8 46. Kc1 Kf7 {White pulls out another
ace out of his pocket} 47. c4 $1 dxc4 48. bxc4 {and the c-pawn's march will
decide the game.}) 46. Qxa6 Qf8 47. Qd3 Ke8 48. Qb5 Qf7 49. Kb2 Kf8 50. Qa6 Ke8

game by Komodo. Stockfish defended tenaciously, but it overestimated its
chances in the very end and was punished swiftly.} 1-0

believe that with accurate play Black should have equalised some way.} 21. Ra3

as long as one doesn't pay too much attention to the fact that it involves
sacrificing a second pawn. The remarkable thing about this game is that while
each pawn sac is perfectly logical in its own right and possible for even a
strong human player, it's very difficult psychologically to keep sacrificing
pawns like this. It's the cumulative effect that makes it so impressive,
especially with queens off the board.} 17. Bxd3 cxd3+ 18. Kxd3 Na4 {White's
position is very uncomfortable. All the Black pieces are (or about to be) very
active, and it's difficult for White to finish his development. The Rh1 is
stuck defending the h-pawn, the Bc1 the b-pawn and the Ra1 is locked in. The
Na3 has a hard time coming back into the game (Nc4 Bb5; Nc2 Bf5+), leaving
only the Ng5 free to operate - but to what end?} 19. f3 {Helping shore up the

continues to develop, with an initiative, e.g.} Rh6 20. Ne4 {and now} Re6 {,
20...Rb6 and 20...Rg6 are all sensible options, highlighting just how many
problems White has here.}) (19. Ke2 {looks like the most human move, getting
the king back before it perishes in the crossfire.}) 19... a5 $1 {Very nice,
simple chess: Black will play ...b5 and ...b4, ripping open the queenside.} 20.
Ne4 f5 21. Nf2 b5 22. Nc2 {This is White's one achievement with f3+Ne4+Nf2:
there's no more worry about ...Bf5+. Black's lead in development is just huge,
however, and with White's king foolhardily leading the charge, it's not
shocking that Black can afford to sac another pawn for more open lines.} b4 $1
{This third pawn sac opens diagonals for both bishops: the Bg7 aims all the
way to b2, while the other bishop can come to b5, with evil intentions for the
white king.} 23. cxb4 Kf7 $1 {A strong quiet move, aiming to use the h-rook on
the d-file, leaving the other one free to operate on the a-file.} (23... Rc8 $1

be a winning attack.}) 24. bxa5 Rxa5 {White's three pawn edge is meaningless:

easy. Black's bishops dominate the board, and White's pawns offer no real

It doesn't seem to have any real purpose, but serves instead as a reflection of the engine's "contempt factor". For those unfamiliar with the term, it refers to the degree to which a chess program is draw-averse. White has an immediate perpetual with 17.Rxg6+ fxg6 18.Qxg6+ Kh8 19.Qh6+ and so on. Now, let's say Shredder thinks draws are perfectly wonderful - not better than wins, but perfectly fine when the position is equal. In that case, it would take the draw immediately. On the other hand, if it's draw-averse, it will take risks to avoid the draw, even if it's worse. (How much risk depends on the "contempt" setting.) 17.f5 at best delays the need for the perpetual (if Black takes, White has nothing better than 18.Rxg6+), but Naum decides that it will go for the win instead.} hxg3 $1 18. fxg6 {Threatening mate, and if Black takes on g6 White has perpetual.

{Nowadays, it's a bit funny annotating games between computer chess engines. Not only are they far stronger than we are - which would be true for almost of all of us annotating super-GM games - they don't generate moves the way we do either. So although Magnus Carlsen is far above us, we can reasonably surmise that a given move was part of a given strategic plan, but when we're looking at computer chess, who knows? There may be nothing more (or less!) than some minor point eight moves down the road that we can barely appreciate and that doesn't fit into our framework for understanding the game. To the extent that that is the case, it makes computer chess inaccessible to the average player (and to most if not all above-average players too, at least much of the time!). When that happens, it will be tough times for both annotator and reader, so what I will try to do is to discuss the game as if it were played with plans, as if it had been played by a very strong human being. Of course this is a fiction, but a useful one, as it will improve our grasp of the game and turn it into something we might use in our games.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5.
